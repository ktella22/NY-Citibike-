## Summary 
Based on the above summary, many of these users may not be the tourists but the local commuter for work. The highest peak check out time is in the morning around 8AM and evening at 5-6PM which are the work hours during the day. The majority of the users are male riders based on the gender users. One significiant point is that most checkout service are for the trip which is less than 10-15 minutes and the trips longer than 20minutes are not used for the bike service. Another thing will be that, if there will be a bike-sharing service in Des Moines, it would be helpful to have bike station within 15-20 minutes distance. It is because New York is a large, busy city, yet Des Moines is suburbs. Things will be further apart in suburbs like Des Moines compared to major cities like New York.
